# Pedestrian-detection-and-human-activity-recognition-using-LSTM-and-time-series-data
Detecting human action recognition system using LSTM, TDNN, and other time-series predictive data analysis by plotting the
heatmap and the correlation data of converted binary array metrics data of the sensor used(Accelerometer, Gyroscope, etc.) in various applications like pedestrian detection, construction project risk management, and other civil-based applications.
